ToDo:
-Make main page
-Link unity projects
-Improve solving algorithm
-Have webpage hosted on a site like heroku

Possible future features:
-Make algorithm able to be visualized on webpage
-Make visualizers for other algorithms
-Be able to produce random sudokus(possibly store all solvable sudoku's in a db and when user wants to generate a random sudoku, pick one from there, alternatively pre program my own)
-Highscores based on time completion, save scores to a db


Bugs:
-With my current brute force algorithm there are some sudoku's that are too hard to brute force and it crashes webpage.
Possible Solution: Learn/make better algorithm
